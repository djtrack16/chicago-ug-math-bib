# Chicago undergraduate mathematics bibliography

This is an annotated bibliography of books that may be useful to undergraduates in pure
mathematics.  I wrote the original version, with the help of some classmates, during my final
year (1997-98) at the University of Chicago.  To my great surprise, it has been useful to many
people over the intervening years, and I am now maintaining it and accepting contributions on
Github.

I am not a "real mathematician", though some of the other contributors to this bibliography
have since gone on to become such.  I'm just some guy; I write software for a living, and try
to learn small bits of math in my smaller bits of spare time.  As you read, I ask that you
forgive the arrogance and ignorance of a younger me, who knew everything, and take this
resource as it was intended: as a guide that might help another student find their way.
